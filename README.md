# IoT-GPS-Tracker
Basically, our project retrieves information from Matlab Mobile Sensors, upload the acquired data from MATLAB Mobile to ThingSpeak Channel, then stream the data from the cloud to our Graphical User Interface. This project consists of a mobile device that collects data and from the sensors which can be turned on by the Matlab app installed. The information collected is then sent instantly to ThingSpeak cloud through online connectivity, to be analyzed in real time. Finally, the data is pulled from the IoT platform into a desktop software environment, in our case, the interface created in AppDesigner.
